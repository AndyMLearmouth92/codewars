A repository filled with Codewars challenges (kata). Currently ranked in the 33rd honour percentile on the global leaderboard and have completed over 100 challenges and push at least five solutions every week.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript

# Optimisations

I consistently refactor and optimise my code, sometimes for efficiency, readability or to try an alternative way of solving a problem. The vast majoirty of my files conatin multiple solutions showing various way to solve the kata.

# Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned in tackling Code Wars questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is fine, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
