A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Currently ranked in the 33rd honour percentile on the global leaderboard and have completed over 100 challenges and push at least 5 solutions every week.

How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar!

Optimisations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
