/* A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr.
For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3]
The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8.
Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr. The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.

Starter code:

function dominator(arr) {
   //code me
}
*/

// Solution: 

function dominator(arr) {
    let charMap = {}
    let maxCharValue = 0
    let maxChar = ''
    for (let char of arr) {
        if (charMap.hasOwnProperty(char)) {
            charMap[char]++
        } else {
            charMap[char] = 1
        }
    }
    for (let char in charMap) {
        if (charMap[char] > maxCharValue) {
            maxCharValue = charMap[char]
            maxChar = char
        }
    }
    return maxCharValue > (arr.length/2) ? Number(maxChar) : -1
