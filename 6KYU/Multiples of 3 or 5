If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

Starter code:

function solution(number){
  
}

Solution 1:

function solution(number){
  //Variable to store the count
  let sum = 0
  //Iterate upto the given number
  for(let i = 1; i< number; i++){
  //Conditional to calculte multiples of 3,5 and both
  if(i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0){
    sum += i
  }else if(i % 3===0){
    sum += i
  }else if(i % 5 === 0){
    sum += i
  }
  }
return sum
}
